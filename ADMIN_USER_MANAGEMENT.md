## Database Schema

### `user_activities` Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE user_activities (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  activity_type VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  description TEXT NOT NULL,
  metadata JSONB,
  ip_address VARCHAR(45),
  user_agent TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

**Indexes:**
- `user_id` - For querying user activities
- `activity_type` - For filtering by activity type
- `created_at` - For chronological sorting

**Row Level Security:**
- Users can view their own activities
- Admins can view all activities
- Service role can insert activities

## Activity Logging Utility

### Usage Example

```typescript
import { logActivity } from "@/app/lib/utils/activityLogger";

// Log a user action
await logActivity({
  userId: session.user.id,
  activityType: "listing_viewed",
  description: "Viewed property: Beautiful House",
  metadata: {
    listing_id: "abc-123",
    listing_title: "Beautiful House",
    listing_price: 500000,
  },
  ipAddress: getIpFromRequest(req),
  userAgent: getUserAgentFromRequest(req),
});
```

### Supported Activity Types

```typescript
type ActivityType =
  | "listing_created"
  | "listing_viewed"
  | "listing_updated"
  | "listing_deleted"
  | "property_searched"
  | "user_login"
  | "user_logout"
  | "user_registered"
  | "profile_updated"
  | "password_changed";
```

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Run Database Migration

1. Open your Supabase Dashboard
2. Go to SQL Editor
3. Run the migration in `migrations/create_user_activities_table.sql`

### Step 2: Verify Setup

Test the user management features:
1. Navigate to `/admin/users`
2. View the list of users
3. Click on a user to see details
4. Try editing a user profile
5. Test password reset functionality

### Step 3: Implement Activity Logging (Optional)

Add activity logging to your existing routes:

```typescript
// In your listing view route
import { logActivity } from "@/app/lib/utils/activityLogger";

export async function GET(req: NextRequest) {
  const session = await auth();
  const listingId = params.id;

  // ... fetch listing logic ...

  // Log the activity
  if (session?.user?.id) {
    await logActivity({
      userId: session.user.id,
      activityType: "listing_viewed",
      description: `Viewed listing: ${listing.title}`,
      metadata: { listing_id: listingId },
    });
  }

  return NextResponse.json({ listing });
}
```
